Andrew Stiefel is a composer and sound artist whose music explores the intersections between written and recorded sound. An experienced field recordist, he was Artist in Residence at Crater Lake National Park in 2012. Since then his work has centered around documenting and interpreting the changing soundscapes of the Pacific Northwest.

His works have been performed by Eighth Blackbird, Prism Saxophone Quartet, and soprano Estelí Gomez, among others. Awards include Grand Prize in the Zvi Zeitlin Memorial International Composers Competition; fellowships at the University of Oregon and Brevard Music Festival; and grants and commissions from New Music USA and Third Angle New Music. 

A founding member of the new music ensemble Sound of Late, his programs as curator have been called “intriguing” and “adventurous” (Oregon ArtsWatch) and have been recognized for their "singular focus on underrepresented composers” (Willamette Weekly). 

He previously directed the Eugene Contemporary Chamber Ensemble, a student ensemble at the University of Oregon, and was Assistant Director of the Oregon Bach Festival Composers Symposium. He studied viola with Dr. Kathryn Steely and Dr. Leslie Straka and composition with Dr. Robert Kyr, Dr. David Crumb, and Dr. Edward Taylor.

He lives in Seattle.
