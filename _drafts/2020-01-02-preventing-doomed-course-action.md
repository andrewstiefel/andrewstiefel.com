How much of our time do we spend thinking about addition? Creating something, advocating for an idea, producing something new? What if we looked beyond what was created — and measured impact by what we didn’t do as well?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My old data science team at Facebook would formally acknowledge a type of impact we called &quot;preventing a doomed course of action.&quot; I love this phrase and the idea that you need to encouraging people to actually *stop* projects when there&#39;s too little upside or too much risk.</p>&mdash; Sean J.

I came across the tweet today, and it inspired me to think about the ways we can do more by doing less.
