### Colophon

A _colophon_ is a fancy designer word for "how this site was made."

I built this website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It is deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). My CMS is just a bunch of markdown files saved in folders. All pixels were designed by me with support from the Bulma CSS framework.

Everything is open source and [published on Github](https://github.com/andrewstiefel/andrewstiefel.com/) under the MIT License.
