<p class="intro is-size-5-tablet">This is the main thing you should read about me.</p>

More about me will go here, obviously. Adding a bit more here.

I'm always happy to meet interesting people for coffee. You can email me at andrew@andrewstiefel.com.

### About the site
This URL has been my online home for many years, manifesting at times as a blog or a portfolio. I designed the current, single-column version of this site to collect my writing in the form of working notes and essays.

In case you were wondering, this site is:

- Coded with Atom
- Built on Jekyll, the open-source static site generator
- Deployed with Netlfiy

Everything is open-source and [published on Github][1] under the MIT License.
