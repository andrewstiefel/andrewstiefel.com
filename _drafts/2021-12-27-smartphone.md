For the past few years I’ve been experimenting with a slimmed-down, minimally functional version of my smartphone — a dumb phone, if you will. If you’re like me, you might be feeling burnt from the constant attention your phone demands. Distraction is in your pocket 24/7.

“By constantly engaging our stress response [when we check our phones], we  ironically are impairing the very cognitive abilities — like memory and attention — that we so desperately need.” - Emma Seppälä, Stanford Psychologist (HBR)

I like this metaphor from [Maxime Vaillancourt][1]:

> Let’s open up an imaginary toolbox for a moment. Imagine a screwdriver.
> 
> A screwdriver is a tool in its purest form. It does not ask for anything, does not require maintenance, and doesn’t distract from the task at hand. It just sits there, patiently waiting to be picked up when needed.
> 
> A tool does its job, then gets out of the way.

This is the kind of relationship I want with my smartphone. It should be tool, and nothing else. Ideally, I would only use it mindfully, with purpose, instead of mindlessly scrolling feeds or checking apps. That isn’t always achievable, or realistic, but there were a number of steps I could take to get control:

## 1. Turn off most or all notifications
Almost none of my apps have permission to give me notifications. I originally tried going completely to none, but I found a few notifications were valuable:

- **Phone and text notifications** (during set hours; I gave family members the ability to reach me any time of day)
- **Charge notifications from my bank and credit cards** (this helped me stop fraudulent charges as they happen)
- **Readwise** (supports an intentional habit of reviewing highlights from my reading sources each morning)

## 2. Remove distracting apps
Every app on my phone has a specific purpose: calling someone, getting directions, adding something to my to-do list, etc. I removed any apps that didn’t have a clear purpose, increased distraction, or most importantly, could reasonably be used on a desktop or laptop computer.

For example, LinkedIn is a valuable tool for networking within my industry. But I don’t have to access it from my phone like say, I would with a GPS app. None of the apps on my phone provide feeds that encourage me to waste time.

If I really need a distraction, I use

I also removed all my email apps. Email is a form of asynchronous communication, so there is no reason I need to be checking it from my phone.

## 3. Organize your home screen
Even

- Rework home screen
- Give the phone a place to live
- Stop using it to replace the function of other tools, like an alarm clock

## 4. Remove internet browsers


## 5. Restrict ability to download apps
At first, the simple changes worked great. But I quickly found myself re-downloading email or other apps when I

So I went nuclear.

## Results
???

After all these changes, it’s still easy to slip back into bad habits. I added social media apps a few months ago and recently purged them again. After the most recent purge, I was able to significantly reduce my screen time again.

Gave phone a place to remove and stopped duplicating other tools (like my alarm clock) that have other single-function tools

## Some extra tips to consider
There were a few tips that just didn’t work for me. They might work for you, so I’ve included them here as reference if you’re looking for some other ideas.

 - **Enable grayscale display mode:** This didn’t stop me from using the phone and, in general, just caused more eye strain,
- **Disable biometric authentication:** I disabled biometric authentication for privacy reason, so this wasn’t a new step. Entering the pass code also doesn’t really stop me from using the phone.
- **Turn off mobile data and wifi:**

## SNIPPETS

If you can, switch to an actual dumb phone and be done with it. I wasn’t willing to buy a replacement for my current phone, however, so tools like the [Light Phone][2] were out.

After working in social media for several years, I was exhausted from being “always on” and available

## 3. Keep the tools you need
I reworked the home screen to focus on the most critical apps I need:

- Phone
- Messages
- Maps
- Calendar
- Things
- Obsidian
- Readwise

I made a concession and kept a few apps with feeds. These are buried in the app library and support thoughtful reading and listening habits:

- Spotify
- Pocket Casts
- Instapaper
