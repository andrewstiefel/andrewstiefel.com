<p class="lead">Social Media & Content Manager at Seattle Symphony. [Other credit here]. Previously at University of Oregon. [Fun fact here].</p>

Hello, I’m Andrew. I help organizations and creative individuals reach, connect with, and mobilize their audiences. For the last seven years I’ve worked for nonprofits and universities with a focus on social media strategy and digital marketing initiatives. 

Currently I’m at the Seattle Symphony, where I connect the orchestra to its audience through creative storytelling, live broadcasts, and other digital engagement projects.

In addition to my work for the Seattle Symphony, I've created social media strategies for political campaigns and nonprofits. I write sometimes. Previously I covered science, technology, and entrepreneurship for the University of Oregon, including a column published in _The Register Guard_. 

Living in Seattle, I love to wander the stunning landscapes of the Pacific Northwest whenever I can escape the city. And when I can't get out of town, you'll often find me at a coffee shop, reading or [working on side projects](https://andrewstiefel.net).

You can find me online at @andrewstiefel. Send me an [email](mailto:andrew@andrewstiefel.com) or ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewstiefel). I'm also on [Github](https://github.com/andrewstiefel) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewstiefel), if you're into that sort of thing.
