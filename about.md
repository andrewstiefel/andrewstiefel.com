**Hello, my name is Andrew Stiefel.** I’m a digital media strategist in Seattle, Washington.

I trained as a classical musician for 18 years. It was hard work, but practicing came easy. Marketing concerts did not. Along the way I discovered that I really enjoyed the new creative challenge.

Over the past eight years I’ve worked with arts organizations, universities, and technology companies with a focus on content strategy for marketing and public relations. These days I’m working with the Seattle Symphony. Previously I worked with scientists and technology entrepreneurs at the University of Oregon.

In my spare time I enjoy reading, cooking, learning to code, and exploring the Pacific Northwest on foot or in a sea kayak.

You can reach me at [hello@andrewstiefel.com](mailto:hello@andrewstiefel.com) or my encrypted email account at [agstiefel@pm.me](mailto:agstiefel@pm.me) for sensitive topics.
