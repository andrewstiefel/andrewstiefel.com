<p class="lead">Social Media & Content Manager at Seattle Symphony. [Other credit here]. Previously at University of Oregon. [Fun fact here].</p>

Hello, I'm Andrew and I'm a digital marketer living and working in Seattle. I specialize in content marketing and social media strategy for organizations and nonprofits. Currently I'm at the Seattle Symphony, where I connect the orchestra to its digital audience through storytelling across live broadcasts, videos, articles, email, and social media. 

In addition to my work for the Seattle Symphony, I've created social media strategy for local political campaigns and nonprofits. I write sometimes. Previously I covered science, technology, and entrepreneurship for the University of Oregon, including a column published in _The Register Guard_. 

Living in Seattle, I love to wander the stunning landscapes of the Pacific Northwest whenever I can escape the city. And when I can't get out of town, you'll often find me at a coffee shop, reading or [working on a side projects](https://andrewstiefel.net).

Send me an [email](mailto:andrew@andrewstiefel.com) or ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewstiefel). I'm also on [Github](https://github.com/andrewstiefel) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewstiefel)] if you're into that sort of thing.
