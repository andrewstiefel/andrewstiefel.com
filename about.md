# About

<p class="intro">My name is Andrew Stiefel. I have a passion for telling stories and building mission-driven brands.</p>

I have the privilege of working at the Seattle Symphony as Senior Communications Manager. I work with an amazing team to produce original journalism, films, podcasts, and educational content.

Through my work for the Symphony, I’ve been fortunate to interview and film some fascinating people, including Stephen Spielberg, John Williams, Caroline Shaw, Yo-Yo Ma, and even the Seahawk’s Russel Wilson.

Previously, I collaborated with scientists and entrepreneurs at the University of Oregon to bring their ideas and products to the world. I’ve also volunteered with political action campaigns supporting equal access to education in Oregon and Washington.

A teacher at heart, I’m passionate about sharing what I’ve learned. Through my blog and courses, I help independent creators learn how to build an audience and tell their story so they can make a living doing what they love.

I love the outdoors and I'm a lifelong birder and hiker. When I’m not working, you can find me at a coffee shop reading or exploring the Pacific Northwest by foot or in a sea kayak.
