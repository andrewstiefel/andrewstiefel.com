Hi, I’m Andrew Stiefel. Originally a classical musician by training, I combine a passion for creativity and a fascination with data to build trust between brands and the people they serve.

I started my career at the University of Oregon, collaborating with scientists and entrepreneurs to bring their ideas and products to the world. Today I keep the Seattle Symphony, a brand with over 100 years of history, at the forefront of creative digital storytelling.

When I’m not working, you can find me at a coffee shop reading, out in the forests bird watching, at home learning to code, or exploring the Pacific Northwest in a sea kayak.

Want to chat about your latest project? I love brainstorming ideas and sharing what I’ve learned, so drop me a note at [hello@andrew.st](mailto:hello@andrew.st). Nothing makes me happier than helping people out.

### How do you say last your name?

My last name is pronounced STEE-full (emphasis on the “STEE” at the beginning). It’s German.
