I'm Andrew Stiefel, a digital strategist and creative copywriter. Originally a classical musician by training, I combine a passion for creativity and a fascination with data to build trust between brands and the people they serve.

For the past few years I’ve worked for the Seattle Symphony. Some of my responsibilities have included writing creative briefs, creating content, analyzing customer data, and managing integrated marketing campaigns. I started my career at the University of Oregon where I collaborated with scientists and entrepreneurs to bring their ideas and products to the world.

When I’m not working, you can find me at a coffee shop reading, at home learning to code, or exploring the Pacific Northwest by foot or in a sea kayak.

Want to chat about your latest project? I love brainstorming ideas and sharing what I’ve learned, so drop me a note at [hello@andrew.st](mailto:hello@andrew.st). Nothing makes me happier than helping people out.
