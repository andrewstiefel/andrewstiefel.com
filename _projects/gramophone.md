The Seattle Symphony was among seven other international ensembles nominated for _Gramophone_'s Orchestra of the Year Award in 2018, and was the only nominee outside of Europe. Selected by Gramophone's editors and critics, the finalists were chosen based on their recordings and the winner was voted on by the general public.

Working with the musicians and the public relations and marketing teams, I created a campaign for email and social media to get out the vote.

The Seattle Symphony won the award in a landslide and the social media campaign was recognized during the award ceremony in London.
