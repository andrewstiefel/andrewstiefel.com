Caroline Shaw is one of the best-known classical composers today. One of the youngest Pulitzer Prize Award winners for music, she has collaborated with Kanye West and other significant artists. The Seattle Symphony presented the world premiere of her piano concerto with Jonathan Biss in February 2019.

I wrote and edited the interview script, which was hosted by my colleague Shiva Shafii and filmed by my colleagues James Holt. The interview was embedded in _The New York Times_ and was used by the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra in their live broadcast of the work.
