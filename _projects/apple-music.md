To help launch the Seattle Symphony's first season with Music Director Thomas Dausgaard, we partnered with Apple Music to celebrate the start of the season. In addition to a takeover of the Classical Radio Station, we curated a playlist with Thomas and built an international campaign for a new release timed with his Opening Night Concert with the orchestra.

I managed the partnership with Apple Music and our distributor, Naxos of America. The campaign resulted in the highest streams and downloads yet for one of the Seattle Symphony's albums.
