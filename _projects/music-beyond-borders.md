The Seattle Symphony organized a free, live concert in response to the first executive order banning travel from seven countries. Approximately a third of the orchestra's musicians are immigrants, so it was an important moment for the organization to stand for its values of inclusivity and respect.

With less than five days to produce the concert, I partnered with Twitter to broadcast the concert on Periscope as well as on Facebook Live and YouTube. I also recruited a team of community managers to shape the online conversation and worked with photographers and a video team to produce content during the live broadcast.

The concert reached over 1.5 million people online and was watched by over 300,000 people around the world. It was covered by _CNN_, _HuffPost_, and _The Seattle Times_ and rebroadcast by KING 5 in Seattle.
