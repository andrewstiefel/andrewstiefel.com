The Seattle Symphony organized a free concert in response to the first executive order banning travel from seven predominately Islamic countries. Approximately a third of the orchestra’s musicians are immigrants, so it was an important moment for the organization to stand for its values of inclusivity and respect.

## Strategy

To maximize the impact of the concert, we pursued live broadcast technology to increase the orchestra’s global reach. I reached out to a contact at Twitter/Periscope to partner and push the concert across their platforms.

Over the 1–2 weeks of the campaign, we converted the orchestra’s social media platforms to stories about music’s power to unite with content about composers, artists, and musicians from the seven impacted countries.

I recruited volunteers to assist with social media management so we could shape the online conversation during the event. I drafted scripts and worked with two photographers to express process images for social media for live coverage on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

## Campaign Elements

* Live concert broadcast on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter/Periscope
* Social media campaign
* Email campaign
* Web content

## Results

The campaign delivered more than 5 million impressions across channels and over 1.9 million on Facebook. Over the campaign, engagement increased by 182% across channels and the concert was watched by more than 350,000 people around the world.

The concert was covered by _CNN_, _HuffPost_, _The Seattle Times_, _Seattle Met_,  _KNKX Radio_, and other media outlets. The video broadcast was picked up by Q4 Fox and KIRO 7 in Seattle and #MusicBeyondBorders trended on Twitter with over 6,200 mentions during the concert.
