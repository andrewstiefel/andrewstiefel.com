I’m always curious what tools people use in their work, so I thought it would compile a list of the tools I use for writing and productivity.

With that being said, use what you're comfortable using or already know how to use. Outcomes are the most important; whatever tools you pick should help you get to the outcomes you want.

But there is a reason why we find tools fascinating. Tools can influence those outcomes, sometimes in a significant way! At least Abraham Lincoln thought so:

> If I only had an hour to chop down a tree, I would spend the first 45 minutes sharpening my axe.

So with that introduction in mind, here’s what I’m using today. Hope you enjoy it!
