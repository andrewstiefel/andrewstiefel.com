I’ve been blogging and hosting my website since 2006, but I was always unhappy with the themes available for technologies like WordPress or the cookie-cutter style of services like Squarespace. (Squarespace was a brief and short-lived experiment for me; I scrapped the entire website within a few months, but that’s a blog post for another day.)

At first, I experimented with developing child themes for WordPress. If you’re not familiar with WordPress, I basically overwrote the CSS stylesheets and built some of my own page and post templates using PHP. I even got good enough that I had clients who would hire me to make changes to their WordPress themes and installations.

All of the tweaks and changes felt cobbled together. In a real sense, I was building Frankenstein sites with dozens of overrides, plugins, and hacks to get what I wanted.

## Deciding on a tech stack

To come

Ultimately, I decided to forgo Ghost as a CMS, at least for now. Personally, I feel safer knowing

## Gathering inspiration

To come

## Getting set up

I won’t go into too much detail on the development process here, but I will link to the tutorials that I found the most helpful while building things out.

As one of the original static website generators, Jekyll benefits from a large community of open-source contributors and users who have documented their techniques and solutions. If you get stuck, there is most likely a tutorial with the answers you need.

## What’s next

Overall I’m pretty happy with the results of the project. I learned a lot along the way and ended up with a website that doesn’t look to bad and is unique to me.

While I don’t need to make any changes in order to write, there are a few areas I might explore in the coming months:

**Implement Tailwind CSS to replace Bulma**
Tailwind CSS is the next logical step from frameworks like Bulma and Bootstrap and would enable more custom design

**Rebuild the site with Gatsby**
???

**Integrate Ghost as a CMS, or move the posts into a standalone repository **
I would prefer to separate my content from the front-end framework

I hope you have a similar positive experience, and please reach out if you have any questions about building your website with Jekyll and Netlify.
