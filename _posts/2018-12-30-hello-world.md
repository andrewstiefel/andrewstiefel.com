This is an example blog post that I'm writing to, well, show what a blog post might look like on this new website. If you're wondering, it's built on Jekyll and the Poole/Lanyon theme by @mdo. Poole is a Jekyll "butler" that provides the basic pages and includes for the framework to function. Handy, but not really necessary.

Anyway, I'm not entirely sure what I will be writing here just yet. Writing about work-related topics seems logical if a bit boring. Oh, did you know that I can [link things](https://google.com) too?

Pretty nifty for a simple post.
