## Why You Should Monetize Your Live Videos
Streaming video accounts for two-thirds of the world’s internet traffic, and by 2021 it will account for [over $70 billion in global revenue][2]. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated adoption as we all look to live video as a way to stay connected. Successful brands and creators are seizing this opportunity, diving head-first into the [live video streaming gold rush][3].

But does it make sense for your business objectives? That should be your guiding question throughout. For many creators, live streaming can be a lucrative way to add to their income. For others, it might be a marketing channel to build awareness of other products and services you’re selling.

## Ask for Tips or Donations
Online tips and donations are quickly becoming a considerable source of revenue for content creators. It’s also one of the easiest ways to start making money from your live streams right away.

You can create accounts with platforms like [Cash.app][4], [PayPal.me][5], ore even [Venmo][6] and start collecting donations right immediately. Just make sure to frequently remind your audience to donate during the live stream and make sure your links are easy to find on your website and social media profiles.

## Sell Tickets (Pay Per View)
If you’re using live video to broadcast events, think of a pay-per-view service as your virtual box office. To sell tickets for a live event, you’ll need two components: a video player for your live stream and a system for restricting access to it.

If you’ve hosted in person events before, you’re probably familiar with [Eventbrite][7]. They’ve launched a new digital events platform that lets you sell tickets in advance to a page that is only accessible to event attendees. Embed the live video player from YouTube and you’re ready to go!

## Sell Subscriptions
Subscription-based models are quickly becoming more popular. You can put all your content behind a pay wall and then charge access to it. Most enterprise platforms like Vimeo OTT and Brightcove aren’t set up for small creators to monetize live streaming, but there are other options.

If you’re willing to broadcast in public, platforms like [Patreon][8] and Twitch make it easy to build communities of engaged subscribers. Content on Twitch isn’t gated; instead, subscribers get unique benefits like chat emojis, chat privileges, and notifications for those who decide to subscribe. You can gate your content with Patreon, offering some of your live streams only to paying monthly subscribers.

## Play Ads
Think ads are only for major publishers? Think again. YouTube and Facebook both offer the ability to enable video ads during your live streams, although you’ll have to reach certain subscriber and engagement thresholds before you can start monetizing your videos.

Instead, you might try signing up for Google Doubleclick for Publishers (DFP) to dynamically insert ads during your live stream. You won’t be able to stream to the main social networks, but you can dynamically insert ads directly into your stream as long as you use services like [Vimeo Live][9] or [Dacast][10].

## Get Sponsorships
This is might be the hardest tactic to implement as you’re getting started, but it’s also potentially the most lucrative once you’ve built an engaged audience that is eager to watch your live videos. It’s also the most straight forward.

In essence a brand pays you to promote their product during the broadcast, either by talking about their product during the live stream or branding them as the sponsor across your marketing materials and in the stream.

## Which method is best?
There is no right answer. Ultimately the strategy you pick for monetizing your live events should align with your business objectives. Are you streaming to build a tight-knit community of fans? Or do you want to build a larger audience for another product you’re going to sell in the future? Is streaming going to be a primary source of revenue for you, or is it more important as a means to build brand awareness and drive traffic towards your other products?

Which ever method you choose, make sure you keep testing and keep streaming until you find the solution that works best for you. Looking for more information about how live video can help you grow revenue for your business?
