Hi, I'm Andrew 👋

I'm a product marketing manager based in Seattle, Washington.

This website is my digital garden, a slowly growing collection of working notes and essays about things I’ve learned over the years.

I often explore topics like developer marketing, online privacy, digital gardening, and building for the indie web.
