<p class="text-2xl font-bold mb-0">Hi, I'm Andrew Stiefel.</p>

This website is my digital garden, a slowly growing collection of working notes and essays about things I’ve learned or created over the years.

I enjoy writing for a small audience here. It’s low stakes and I occasionally connect with folks who are interested in something random I wrote. 

I often explore topics like developer marketing, online privacy, digital gardening, and building for the indie web.
