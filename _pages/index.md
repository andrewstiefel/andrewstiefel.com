I’m a product marketing manager based in Bremerton, Washington.

This website is my digital garden, a slowly growing collection of working notes and essays about things I’ve learned or created over the years.

I enjoy writing for a small audience here. It’s low stakes and I occasionally get connected with folks who are interested in something random I wrote about. Maybe you’ll find something I wrote interesting, too.
