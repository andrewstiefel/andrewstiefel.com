Hey, I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my digital garden, a slowly growing collection of [notes](/notes/) and [essays](/essays/).

Trained in classical music and inspired by biology, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to complex systems and how we make sense of them. My work centers on clarifying complexityâ€”whether in [technology](/topics/technology/), [marketing](/topics/product-marketing/), or [writing](/topics/writing/).
