  Hi, I'm Andrew Stiefel.
</p>
<p>
  This website is my digital garden, a slowly growing collection of working notes and essays about things I’ve created or learned over the years.
</p>
<p>
  I tend to write about whatever I’m currently working on or thinking about at the time. Practically, you can usually expect something about:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/tag/product-marketing/">Product marketing</a></li>
  <li><a href="/tag/writing/">Writing advice</a></li>
  <li><a href="/tag/coding/">Web design</a></li>
</ul>
