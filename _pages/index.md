Hey, I'm Andrew 👋

Welcome to my digital garden, a slowly growing collection of working [essays](/essays/), [guides](/guides/), and [notes](/notes/).

Trained in classical music and inspired by natural ecosystems, I’ve always been drawn to complex systems and how we make sense of them. My work seeks to create clarity, whether I'm writing about [digital culture](/topics/technology), [marketing](/topics/product-marketing/), or [building for the web](/topics/coding).
