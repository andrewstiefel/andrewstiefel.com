Hey, I'm Andrew. I'm based near Seattle, Washington and enjoy hanging out with my family and our two rabbits, music, writing, gardening, and generally creating things. I lead product marketing for a cybersecurity company specializing in code security for developers.

This website is my digital garden, a slowly growing collection of working notes and essays about things I've learned over the years. I tend to write about whatever I'm working on at the time, which means I often cover topics like developer marketing, software security, digital privacy, and building for the indie web. Some posts are polished essays, others are works in progress—that's the garden part.

I enjoy writing for a small audience here. It's low stakes and I occasionally get connected with folks who are interested in something I wrote about. If that's you, I hope you'll reach out.
