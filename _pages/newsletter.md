**Margin Notes** is my newsletter where I share a few long-form articles each month.

## Why call it "margin notes"?

Margin notes (often referred to as marginalia) are the comments, notes, drawings, and other scribbes added to the margins of books. I've come to appreciate that most of my thinking happens _in the margins_: while walking, in brief notes, and especially in my first drafts.

## Why subscribe?

There are a lot of fantastic newsletters out there already where you can get a list of the week's top links. Rather than add another weekly round up to your inbox, I tend to share my original writing, albeit less frequently. 

When I was thinking about the newsletter I would want to read, I realized I wanted something other than the standard round up of links or narrowly-focused beat. (You know the ones: "get actionable tips about product marketing" or "this newsletter is for people who like tech".)

Instead, I wanted to create a space to explore the creative process _while it is happening_. I've always been fascinated with how people work, and in particular, how they develop ideas. You could think of this newsletter as a source of ideas â€“ whether you are interested in writing, the creative process, navigating a career, or simply thinking about life online today.
