# About me
I am a product marketing manager with 8+ years experience leading go-to-market strategy and product launches for B2B and B2C companies in the technology, education, nonprofit, and science industries. I have 2+ years product marketing experience in B2B cloud infrastructure and services.

I have a deep interest in narrative strategy â€” how companies use storytelling to differentiate themselves in the market, drive product adoption, and accelerate growth. I've worked with global brands and nonprofits to define their vision, craft their positioning and messaging, and drive high-impact campaigns. 
 
Currently I'm helping build a better internet with F5 NGINX (pronounced engine-X). NGINX builds cloud-native, Kubernetes-friendly open source and enterprise tools for developers. NGINX delivers mission-critical apps and APIs for more than 450 million websites ranging from individual creators to Fortune 500 companies.
