# About me
I am a product marketing manager with 8+ years experience leading go-to-market strategy and product launches for B2B and B2C companies in the technology, education, nonprofit, and science industries. I have 2+ years product marketing experience in B2B cloud infrastructure and services.

I have a deep interest in narrative strategy â€” how companies use storytelling to differentiate themselves in the market, drive product adoption, and accelerate growth. I've worked with global brands and nonprofits to define their vision, craft their positioning and messaging, and drive high-impact campaigns.
