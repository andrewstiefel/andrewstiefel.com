This page was last updated on <time date="{{ page.last_modified_at | date_to_xmlschema }}" itemprop="dateModified">{{ page.last_modified_at | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</time> from near Seattle, Washington. The purpose of the page is to share what I'm up to and working on currently. I aim to update it every few months.

## Currently
- Imagining what life I'll be proud of ten years from now
- Planting trees, bushes, and the winter vegetable garden
- Painting the house, picnic table, and other outdoor furniture

## Making
- Hacking away on projects like this site and whatever else I can find time for
- Writing on this blog about whatever comes to mind
- Getting back into water colors

## Reading
- James by Percival Everett
- The History of Sound by Ben Shattuck
