I aim to update this page every few months. It was last updated on <time date="{{ page.last_modified_at | date_to_xmlschema }}" itemprop="dateModified">{{ page.last_modified_at | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</time> from near Seattle, Washington. 

## Work
I stepped into my first team leadership role at work in October. I've also been traveling for some speaking engagements, most recently CybermarketingCon in Austin, TX to lead a workshop on positioning AI products.

## Personal
 I'm helping my parents settle into their new condo, which has meant more time with paintbrushes than I expected. In the rare quiet moments, I'm working through Terry Pratchett's Tiffany Aching series and occasionally writing on this blog when work allows.
