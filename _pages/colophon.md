This website was first published in the fall of 2011 in Waco, Texas. It was built on a self-hosted server using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). It's gone through several iterations over the years as a blog and portfolio, and I've rebuilt it a few times. I designed and built the current version myself with a focus on minimizing its [carbon footprint](https://digitalbeacon.co/report/andrewstiefel-com).

Everything is open source and published on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewstiefel/andrewstiefel.com) if you'd like to poke around.

## Design
The theme is inspired by antique field guides and paper notebooks, and designed to showcase text and code on digital screens. The color palette is loosely based on [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki) by [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/), particularly for accent colors and code highlighting. The biggest difference is in the gray scale—I created a custom neutral range with less saturation in the backgrounds, which I find gentler on the eyes.

## Typography
All fonts are self-hosted for privacy and performance. The body copy is set in Literata by TypeTogether. UI elements are in Inter by Rasmus Andersson.

## Technologies
I optimized the site for performance and a low carbon footprint. I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static files, deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Images are served by [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

To keep things lightweight, I built the theme with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (resulting in less than 10KB of CSS) and use vanilla JavaScript instead of heavy libraries. Page sizes typically stay under 200KB, with a 500KB maximum.

All posts are written in markdown for portability. My content management system (CMS) is a bunch of files and folders on my operating system. I use GitHub for version control and backups.
