This website was first published in the fall of 2011 in Waco, Texas. It was built on a self-hosted server using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). It's gone through several iterations over the years as a blog and portfolio, and I've rebuilt it a few times. I designed and built the current version of the site myself. It is optimized to have a [very low carbon footprint](https://digitalbeacon.co/report/andrewstiefel-com). 

Everything is open souce and published on <a href="https://github.com/andrewstiefel/andrewstiefel.com">GitHub</a> if you'd like to poke around.

## Design
The theme is inspired by antique field guides and paper notebooks. It is designed to showcase text and code on digital screens. The color palatte is loosely based on [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki) by [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/). The biggest differences are in dark mode. I prefer a lower contrast background that is gentler on the eyes than a deep black.

## Typography
All fonts are self-hosted for privacy and performance. The body copy is set in Inter by Rasmus Andersson. Headers are set in Roboto Condensed by Christian Robertson. You'll also see some supporting serif font, which is Source Serif by Frank Grie√ühammer.

## Technologies
I use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a> to generate the static files for this website. The site is deployed with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" title="Netlify">Netlify</a> so I don't have to worry about managing a server. Images are served by <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a>.

I used <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" title="Tailwind CSS">Tailwind CSS</a> to build and design the site theme and individual components. An atomic design framework, it provides a set of utility classes for your HTML markup. The result is a tiny CSS file (less than 10KB) without any of the bloat you find with other CSS frameworks. 

Scripts are vanilla Javascript. I wanted to avoid using any heavy JS libraries.

As a result the page size is under 500KB, and often under 200KB depending on the content.

All the individual posts are written in markdown for ease of portability. My content management system (CMS) is a bunch of files and folders on my operating system. I use GitHub for version control and backups.
