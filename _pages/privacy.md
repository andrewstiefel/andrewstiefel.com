<h1>You’re being watched.</h1>

<p>Imagine if every time you walked into a physical store, someone scanned a barcode on your body to learn who you are.</p>

Then, they followed you around the store and took notes about everything you picked up, put back, or purchased. When you finally leave, they send that information to a central agency. Now, people follow you around — to your home, your work — suggesting similar products to you.

Understandably, this would freak you out. But this is the agreement we’ve (so far) struck with online advertisers. It’s creepy, and it’s done without your explicit permission.

Sure, they might flash a banner about cookies. But cookie warnings don’t solve the problem, either. They only clutter the web. And in most cases, you don’t have a choice. Accept the cookies and tracking, or leave. Even then, you've alrady been tracked.

**Here’s the point of this post: this website does not track you. **

As a former digital marketer, I’ve been thinking a lot about privacy and tracking. I’m as guilty as anyone. I’ve collected tens of millions of points of data about people and shared it with Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other platforms _without explicit permission_ from those people.

We can do better. I can do better.

This website does not use cookies or tracking of any kind. And neither do my emails. I’m encouraging my clients to change their digital marketing practices as well.

If you run a website, I encourage you to do the same. For most of us, there are no benefits to allowing our visitors to be tracked. We’re simply being complicit in the name of getting “free” analytics from services like Google Analytics.

If you still want to know how many people are visiting your website, there are ways to do so without tracking anyone.

Personally, I use [Fathom Analytics][1], a privacy-first, paid software alternative that doesn’t collect or store personal information. Visitor data is collected anonymously and gives me just enough information so I can understand how people are finding my website and what content they are finding useful.

If you want to give Fathom Analytics a try, you can [use this referral link for $10 off your first invoice](https://usefathom.com/ref/FBJDFZ){:title="Fathom Analytics" id="clickAff" target="_blank"}. This isn’t a paid promotion and so far I make $0 from referrals. I’m just a happy customer.

**Our choices matter.** If you care about online privacy, pay attention and choose businesses and tools that put your privacy first.
