    <p class="lead">Social Media &amp; Content Manager at Seattle Symphony. Previously at University of Oregon. Classical music geek.</p>
    
    <p>I help organizations and creative individuals reach, engage, and  mobilize their audiences. For the past seven years I’ve worked for  nonprofits and universities with a focus on social media strategy and digital marketing.</p>

    <p>Currently I work for the Seattle Symphony. I connect the orchestra to its audience through storytelling, live broadcasts and other projects.</p>

    <p>In addition to my work for the Seattle Symphony, I’ve created social media strategy for political campaigns and nonprofits. I write sometimes. Previously I covered science and entrepreneurship for the University of Oregon. I also wrote a column about startups and technology for the <em>The Register Guard</em>.</p>

    <p>I love to wander the stunning landscapes of the Pacific Northwest whenever I can escape the city. When I can’t get out of town, you’ll often find me at a coffee shop, reading, writing, or working on <a href="https://andrewstiefel.net">side projects</a>.</p>
