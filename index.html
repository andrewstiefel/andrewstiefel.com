  Hello, my name is Andrew Stiefel.
</h2>
<p>
  This website is my digital garden, a slowly growing collection of working notes and essays about things I’ve learned over the years.
</p>
<p>
  I tend to write about whatever I’m interested in, which is a lot of things. Practically, you can usually expect something about:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product marketing</li>
  <li>Writing</li>
  <li>Career growth</li>
</ul>
